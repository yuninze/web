Nicotine AUC typically peaks within 30 minutes of exposure and then declines gradually over time. The elimination half-life of nicotine is about 2 hours, which means that it takes about 2 hours for the nicotine concentration in the blood to be reduced by half.

Nicotine AUC can vary depending on a number of factors, including the route of administration, the dose of nicotine, and the individual's metabolism. For example, nicotine AUC is typically higher in smokers than in non-smokers.
